This is a fun little application I made for Gifs. You can search any word, any subject, practically anything and it will generate a rows and columns full of gifs related to your search. The application will then trigger and produce buttons with a link to the input the user previsouly entered. 

There is no real world use of this application besides it being quite fun.
